## Coding Guidelines and Development üõ†

- Ensure you read the readme.txt (https://github.com/raaspify/raaspi-jee/readme.txt)
- Run our build process described in the document on [how to set up Raaspi development environment](https://github.com/raaspify/raaspi-jee/wiki/How-to-set-up-Raaspi-development-environment), it will use templates and non template sources to generate final java and html files
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the trunk branch of the Raaspi-jee repository.
- Make sure to write good and detailed commit messages (see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this) and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.
- Please create a change file for your changes by running `pnpm --filter=<project> changelog add`. For example, a change file for the Raaspi Core project would be added by running `pnpm --filter=raaspi changelog add`. 
- Please avoid modifying the changelog directly or updating the .pot files. These will be updated by the Raaspi team.
