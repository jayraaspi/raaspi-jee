notes:
Adding the SPF record explicitly also allows Mandrill to send on your behalf and the DKIM record lets Mandrill digitally
'sign' emails for your domain. Without this record, Mandrill still adds a DKIM signature to your emails,
but it's signed for the Mandrill sending server instead of your domain, for example:

From: someone@gmail.com via mandrillapp.com
or    manager mail@3rcomputer.com via mail114.us4.mandrillapp.com 
to remove via add dkim record
v=spf1 include:spf.mandrillapp.com ?all

If you already have a TXT record with SPF information, you'll need to add Mandrill's servers to that record by adding include:spf.mandrillapp.com in the record (before the last operator, which is usually ?all, ~all, or -all).
DKIM Record

Add a new TXT record with the name mandrill._domainkey.yourdomain.com (just replace yourdomain.com with the domain you're setting up).


setting up custom signing domain ie to send as
From: someone@gmail.com via yourdomain.com
setup sending domain in mandrill and spf/dkim in hostpapa as usual but enable a custom signing domain using Settings > Sending Deafults > Custom SPF/DKIM Signing Domain
